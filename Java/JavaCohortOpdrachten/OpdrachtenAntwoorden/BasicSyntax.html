        <p>Opdracht 1 - Basic Syntax

            Voordat je Java kan gebruiken moet je de syntax kunnen begrijpen. Doe onderzoek naar de
            volgende termen en leg uit wat ze (voor Java) betekenen:
            <br>
            Object: An object is a software bundle of variables and related methods. You can
            represent real-world objects using software objects. <br>
            Class: A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
            <br>
            Package: A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and
            interfaces.<br>
            Constructor: A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize
            objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used
            to set initial values for object attributes.<br>
            Instance: An object and an instance are the same thing.<br>
            Method: A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

            You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.

            Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.

            Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.<br>
            Class > Class Constructor > Method > Initialized
        </p>
