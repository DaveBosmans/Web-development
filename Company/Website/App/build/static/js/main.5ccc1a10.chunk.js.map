Use <code>.disabled</code> for links that appear un-clickable and <code>.active</code> to indicate the current page.</p>\n            <p>While the <code>.disabled</code> class uses <code>pointer-events: none</code> to <em>try</em> to disable the link functionality of <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s, that CSS property is not yet standardized and doesn’t account for keyboard navigation. As such, you should always add <code>tabindex=\"-1\"</code> on disabled links and use custom JavaScript to fully disable their functionality.</p>\n\n            <div className=\"bd-example\">\n
